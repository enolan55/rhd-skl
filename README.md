Recognizing handwritten digits with Scikit-learn - A beginner ML project
The 'Digits' dataset in Scikit-learn consists of 1,797 images that are 8x8 pixels in size.
Each image is a handwritten digit in grayscale.
Define a predictive model and instruct it with a training set.
Test the trained svc estimator with six digits from the training set.
Validate the test by comparing the output with that of the actual digits.
